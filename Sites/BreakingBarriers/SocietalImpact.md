## Ease of Access

> "My Mac makes it so much easier for me to get the tools I need right when I need them and I always know they are going to work. With a PC, I had to research software options, find one that I could download (or wait to get a disc in the mail) and then just hope it didn't crash my computer when I installed it. Now, with the Mac and especially with last year's addition of the AppStore, apps are available for immediate download any time I want one.
