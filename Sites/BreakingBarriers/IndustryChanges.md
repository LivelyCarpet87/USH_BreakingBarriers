# Industry Changes

## Standardization of the GUI

Before Apple I and the Apple II, computers were very difficult to use. Using the computer required the toggling of the row of switches to the correspond to the desired opcode (a computer command) represented in binary (0/1), then trigger the 'DEPOSIT NEXT' switch to run that desired command. To do so required the user to remember a large amount of opcodes or refer to a large cheat sheet. The end result would also be displayed using a row of lights, and required the user to decode into meaningful information. In short, the computers took input in the form of an array of on/off switches and gave output by displaying a pattern with a row of lights.

Notice that it is fully encased and assembled, with a builtin keyboard and a monitor.                                                        |

Clearly, this was very difficult to use, inefficient, and blocked the computer from entering people's everyday lives like they have today. The Apple I was one of the first computers designed by default to use a video display for output and a keyboard for input. The Apple II was one of the first computers to come with a video display and a keyboard by default. This allowed the input and output of text and other media, which made it significantly easier to use computers, shattering one of the remaining barriers preventing personal use of computers by the general public.

## Changes in Design

Before Steve Jobs promoted the Apple II, computers were more ugly and exposed. As shown below on the left, the internal electronics would be exposed for easy maintenance and tweaking and the entire thing would be loosely connected together. The degree of complexity of assembly and the aesthetics barred non-computer people from really adopting computers.

However, the Apple II changed this. Steve Jobs insisted that the Apple II had to look good, and hence the entire computer was pre-assembled and enclosed in a sleek plastic shell. This not only protected the computer, but also made it look cleaner and nicer than the hobbyists' computers sold at that time. This shattered the aesthetic barrier that prevented the entry of personal computers into our homes.

## Runs Out The Box

Before the Apple II, there weren't many viable personal computers. The smaller cheaper computers were for hobbyists and came as parts. Steve Jobs broke this barrier to Personal Computers (PCs) that are integral to our life today with the Apple II. The computer cam pre-assembled with all necessary software installed, which was a major step forward from the DIY computers of that day. This allowed the average person to also use the computer like we do today.

## Implementation of the Touchscreen and Internet Access

Finally, there is the iPhone, a key to Apple's profit generation today. The iPhone was the first to use a touchscreen and broadened the use of phones in our lives. Before the iPhone, mobile phones were difficult to use and were limited to calling/texting. The computer was the only device capable of surfing the web. The pocket-sized music players were the only way to listen to music on the go. The iPhone broke this barrier with the touchscreen and internet access. The iPhone used a touchscreen, allowing it to do away the basic keyboards that limited the use of phones. By doing so, the phone was able to have a larger and more efficiently used screen. When paired with internet connectivity, the iPhone became a platform for web browsing and, eventually, other apps that enriched our lives. It became possible to listen to music, read a blog, and contact you friends, all from the same device. The iPhone broke the barrier that barred phones from other areas of our lives.
