## Integration of Tech

The Apple II computer was far more than a technological advancement. The Apple II was the portal allowing the public to use computers without extensive training. The Apple II is the reason behind the integration of technology in out lives today. Without it, only programmers today would be using computers after learning how to extensively. The majority of society would likely still be using pen and paper. Social media would not have existed. The internet would have been an empty void compared to today. Supermarkets wouldn't have barcode scanners. (Myles) Needless to day, the Apple II had a major impact on how technology exists in our lives today.

## Social Media

Social media was only able to take off and become so prevalent in our lives because of how the Apple II standardized the GUI. Without it, websites like MySpace and Friendster would have never been possible, not to mention Facebook or Twitter. The impact of the GUI of Apple II prevailed long after the computer itself was no longer produced.
