# Industry Changes

In 1984, Apple introduced the Apple II, a revolutionary computer created by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. The computer shattered the barrier of technical complexity barricading the average person from using a computer by:

- implementing a graphical user interface

- implementing a keyboard

- pre-installing the computer with necessary programs

This computer does not come with pre-installed programs. | Shown above is the Apple II computer. It uses a graphical user interface (GUI) with a keyboard. It is sold with a basic operating system pre-installed.                            |

## Runs Out The Box

Before the Apple II, there weren't many viable personal computers. The smaller cheaper computers were for hobbyists and came without programs pre-installed. Users had to manually code the programs or get copies from others. Again, this required a lot of computer related skills to achieve, supporting the barrier of complexity of computer complexity. Apple II changed this and led to a new industry standard. The Apple II computer came pre-assembled with an operating system (OS) and commands installed, which was a major step forward from the DIY computers of that day. This allowed the average person to also use the computer with less required knowledge beforehand.

## Standardization of the GUI

Before Apple I and the Apple II, computers were very difficult to use. As stated in the previous page, using the computer required a large amount of effort and technical know-how. 

> Five years ago, technology hindered us, but with Apple, technology now lifts us."

The Apple I was one of the first computers designed by default to use a video display for output and a keyboard for input. This allowed the input and output of text and other media, which made it significantly easier to use computers. This change negated the need for users to translate input and output to and from binary to represent their answers. Furthermore, thanks to the graphical interface, text could be outputted directly instead of needing to be translated from an ASCII number table. This shattered the barrier of complexity preventing personal use of computers by the general public. 

Eventually, because the GUI was more intuitive and efficient, it became an industry standard like it is today.

## Implementation of the Touchscreen and Internet Access

Finally, there is the iPhone, a key to Apple's profit generation today. The iPhone was the first to use a touchscreen and broadened the use of phones in our lives. Before the iPhone, mobile phones were difficult to use and were limited to calling/texting. The computer was the only device capable of surfing the web. The pocket-sized music players were the only way to listen to music on the go. The iPhone broke this barrier with the touchscreen and internet access. The iPhone used a touchscreen, allowing it to do away the basic keyboards that limited the use of phones. By doing so, the phone was able to have a larger and more efficiently used screen. When paired with internet connectivity, the iPhone became a platform for web browsing and, eventually, other apps that enriched our lives. It became possible to listen to music, read a blog, and contact you friends, all from the same device. The iPhone broke the barrier that barred phones from other areas of our lives.
