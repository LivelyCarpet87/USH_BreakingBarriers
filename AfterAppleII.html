<blockquote>
<p>"My Mac makes it so much easier for me to get the tools I need right when I need them and I always know they are going to work. With [other computers], I had to research software options, find one that I could download (or wait to get a disc in the mail) and then just hope it didn't crash my computer when I installed it."</p>
<p>--Rachel Honoway, Honoway Interactive, LLC (<a target="_blank" href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/Bibliography.html#mulvey">Mulvey</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the Apple II, there weren't many viable personal computers. The smaller cheaper computers were for hobbyists and came without programs pre-installed. Users had to manually code the programs or get copies from others. Again, this required a lot of computer related skills to achieve, supporting the barrier of complexity of computer complexity. Apple II changed this and led to a new industry standard. The Apple II computer came pre-assembled with an operating system (OS) and commands installed, which was a major step forward from the DIY computers of that day. This allowed the average person to also use the computer with less required knowledge beforehand.</p>
<h3 class="atx" id="standardization-of-the-gui">Standardization of the GUI</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Jobs discovered the first 'graphical user interface,' or GUI, developed at Xeroxâ€™s Palo Alto Research Center. The breakthrough made the computer much easier to master for the average person, who could simply click on a file to view it, rather than typing in commands."</p>
  <p>--Mercury News (<a target="_blank" href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/Bibliography.html#boudreau">Boudreau</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the Apple II, computers were very difficult to use. As stated in the previous page, using the computer required a large amount of effort and technical know-how. The Apple I and the Apple II was one of the first computers designed by default to use a video display for output and a keyboard for input. This allowed the input and output of text and other media, which made it significantly easier to use computers. This change negated the need for users to translate input and output to and from binary to represent their answers. Furthermore, thanks to the graphical interface, text could be outputted directly instead of needing to be translated from an ASCII number table. This shattered the barrier of complexity preventing personal use of computers by the general public. </p>
<p>Eventually, because the GUI was more intuitive and efficient, it became an industry standard like it is today. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"There is no doubt that, since 1977 and the launch of Apple II - the first computer it produced for the mass market - many things which used to be done on paper, or on the telephone, have been done easier and faster on a screen."</p>

<p>
  Needless to say, society without the Apple II would be vastly different. The Apple II was the necessary simplification to allow non-programmers to use computers. Without its changes, only highly-trained people would be able to use computers. The rest of us would be forced to continue to use pen and paper because of the overwhelming complexity (<a href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/BeforeAppleII.html#actual-usage">as mentioned before</a>). Information would not have been able to be stored nor transferred at such high speed as we experience today. Nobody would not be able to use computers without intensive training. Technological improvements of calculation speed would have been offset by the interfaces that facilitate errors and slow information input/output.

  The Apple II computer was far more than a technological advancement. The Apple II opened up computing to the general public. It is the reason behind the integration of technology in our lives today. Nowadays, almost everyone who could afford a computer could use one. Thanks to the Apple II, social media became possible as almost everyone was able to use the internet due to improved accessibility. Thanks to the Apple II, supermarkets today could have self-checkout barcode scanners that could be operated by anyone.

<h3 class="atx" id="social-media">Social Media Use</h3>
<p>The internet and social media platforms were only able to take off and become so prevalent in our lives because of how the Apple II standardized the GUI. Without the newer norm of using a GUI, people would not have been able to surf the web today. Without visuals, webpages would have been boring and unnattractive, not exciting and full of pictures of cats. Without the visuals, websites like Myspace and Friendster, the predecessors of Facebook and Twitter, would have never been possible. Thanks to the Apple II opening the door to computing to the general public, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat can now connect the word. The impact of the GUI of Apple II prevailed long after production of the computer itself.</p>
