The Apple II broke the barrier of technical complexity that prevented the general public from using computers for everyday tasks. Computers before the Apple II required complex understanding and knowledge to use. The Apple II made computers more accessible to the general public by implementing a Graphical User Interface and pre-installed programs. This formed a new industry standard and broke down the barrier of complexity barring the computer from being used in everyday life. This allowed us to use computers in the many aspects of our life as we do today.
