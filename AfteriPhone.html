<h2 class="atx" id="how-the-iphone-broke-the-barrier">How the iPhone Broke the Barrier</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The iPhone looks like it was teleported from the future. The competition, in comparison, look like ... well, phones... The interface is intuitive and straightforward, and multi-touch works like a dream. Merely tap the screen, or drag your finger across it depending on which function you need. And remember, this is glass, not plastic."</p>
  <p>--Michael DeAgonia (<a target="_blank" href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/Bibliography.html#deagonia">DeAgonia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="atx" id="touchscreen">Touchscreen</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Rather than what [Steve Jobs] called 'small plastic keyboards,' the iPhone will have a display that becomes both the keyboard and control panel, morphing to suit the current application."</p>
  <p>--New York Times (<a target="_blank" href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/Bibliography.html#markoff">Markoff</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The iPhone was the first phone to use its patented multi-touch touchscreen (US Patent). Its touchscreen allowed it to display greater amounts of information. Before, phone screens were limited by the size of the keyboard they shared space with. After the touchscreen, the phone could take over the face of the phone and conjure a keyboard as needed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It also changed the terms of what the device was for: A BlackBerry or Treo was for text input, for email. An iPhone was for... anything? The keyboard was there when you needed it, but it wasn't a core part of the product."</p>
<p>--Tech Republic (<a target="_blank" href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/Bibliography.html#snell">Snell</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the iPhone, controls became intuitive:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tapping on something would open it. This replaced the less instinctive scroll key, also known as the Navi<sup>TM</sup> key, common on the phones preceding it. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Pinching fingers on the screen would zoom in/out. This replaced the complex keyboard shortcuts of 2 to 3 keys preceding the touchscreen. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Swiping up and down would scroll up and down. This replaced the up/down key presses to scroll through menus.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Onscreen buttons had custom icons and appeared as needed. This replaced the need for highly confusing shortcuts preceding the iPhone. (<a target="_blank" href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/Bibliography.html#nokia-e63-user-guide">Nokia E63 User Guide</a>)</p>

<h3 class="atx" id="memory">Memory</h3>
<p>The iPhone has a major increase in memory compared to the other phones before it. Its memory increased from the common smaller 120 Mb (<a target="_blank" href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/Bibliography.html#cha">Cha</a>) to 8Gb or 16 Gb (<a target="_blank" href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/Bibliography.html#iphone-technical-specifications">"iPhone - Technical Specifications"</a>). With this increase, more data was storable on the phone and more tasks became feasible. The increased memory space paved the way for larger, more complex apps. Users no longer had to worry as much about disk size. Games, tools, offline maps, streaming all became possible to implement with the increased storage. The increased storage did not simply make it easier to make complex apps, it gave them the ability to exist. </p>
<h3 class="atx" id="industry-standards">Industry Standards</h3>
<p>Apple's impact was not limited to the iPhone's improvements. Soon after the release of the iPhone, many other tech companies caught on, and Apple formed entire new industry standards with the iPhone, leading to what we refer to as smart phones today. Smartphones today are thin and sleek, can run a wide assortment of apps, and are supported by a wide. </p>
<h2 class="atx" id="how-the-iphone-changed-history">How the iPhone Changed History</h2>
<p>The simplified the controls of the iPhone, combined with its increased memory size, broke the barrier of technical complexity preventing users from using complex apps. </p>

<ol>
<li>GPS</li>
</ol>
<p>iPhones and other smartphones have replaced the GPS terminals we used in our cars in the past. Nowadays, we simply snap our smartphones, installed with apps like Waze, into a special grip. The smartphones were successful in replacing the GPS terminal partly because of their increased screen size, ability to download maps, and pinpoint accurately our locations. </p>

<p>Because of the easier interface, browser apps such as Safari are able to be used effortlessly on phones. Controls such and swiping and pinching made web browsing faster and more intuitive. The increased memory and dedicated browser app made rendering full webpages possible. These changes together were able to fully replace the phone browsers of the past, making internet surfing no longer limited to the computers. Furthermore, this phenomena prompted websites to make better mobile versions of their sites to replace the watered-down WAP websites of the past, further simplifying people's access to the web. The iPhone's revolution singlehandedly lead to the replacement of old mobile browsers and old mobile webpages. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Thanks to the iPhone, full-screen touch screens and full-featured Web browsers will become standard on cell phones, they say." </p>
  <p>--Mercury News quoting analysts in 2007 (<a target="_blank" href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/Bibliography.html#wolverton">Wolverton</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"iPhone also features the most advanced and fun-to-use web browser on a portable device with a version of its award-winning Safari™ web browser for iPhone. Users can see any web page the way it was designed to be seen, and then easily zoom in to expand any section by simply tapping on iPhone’s multi-touch display with their finger."

<ol>
<li>Mobile Gaming</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to the greater degrees of freedom in designing tactile controls and the ability to save more content offline, game developers could make more complex games. Hence, mobile games developed beyond simple games like Breakout. Over time, same such as first-person-shooter PUBG and idle-game FarmVille were introduced to mobile phones. Today, in part because of the introduction of tactile controls, the Apple App Store "provide[s] 903,489 gaming apps" (<a target="_blank" href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/Bibliography.html#clement">Clement</a>), reflecting the thriving mobile gaming industry. </p>

<li>Social Media</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "With the iPhone’s touchscreen and easy-to-use interface, texting has now become as natural as speaking... The iPhone also fueled the rise of social media. Snapchat, of course, is mobile-only, Instagram is mobile-first and more than 90% of Facebook’s daily active users access the platform via mobile. We broadcast vacations and nights out by taking photos on our phones and instantly sharing them through an app. We check and post news in real time through Twitter. We share live video and funny moments we eventually want to disappear."

<p>Without the touchscreen, features such as endless-scrolling content feeds would not have been possible. Nobody would have been willing to press the down button multiple times to browse content, and certainly the smaller screens would have been too small for viewing. Thanks to the invention of the iPhone breaking down those barriers of complexity for the phone, smartphones can now host addictive social-media apps designed around a content feed. The breaking of the barrier made companies like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook as prevalent as they are today. </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Ride-Sharing/Food Delivery</li>
</ol>
<p>With the introduction of the touchscreen, combined with improved GPS accuracy, phones like the iPhone were able to serve complex menus that could be navigated intuitively. This capability of a device that went everywhere with users, allows people to call a Lyft ride or order from Uber-Eats anytime (<a target="_blank" href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/Bibliography.html#leswing">Leswing</a>). Compounded with the fact that smartphones almost follow us everywhere, these services became prevalent in our lives. Needless to say, the iPhone has helped form these two growing industries. </p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Video Downloading &amp; Streaming</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "The iPhone created a mobile platform for video delivery, and since 2007 every major movie and TV studio has been forced to expand their distribution methods to include downloaded and streaming services to mobile devices."
  </p><p>--Time (<a target="_blank" href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/Bibliography.html#bajarin">Bajarin</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a larger screen, smartphones were able to display video content at greater dimensions. More importantly, the increased memory allowed the downloading and buffering of video content from sites like YouTube on phones, leading to an increase in viewership for YouTube from platforms other than the computer. Thanks to the iPhone, watching video content was no longer limited to computers. Because smartphones follow us everywhere we go, this significantly boosted YouTube's viewership and helped it expand. </p>
<h3 class="atx" id="behaviors-changes">Behaviors Changes</h3>
<ol>
<li>Phone Use</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Ever since the introduction of the smart phone, phones have become an important part of our lives. It serves as an assistant, tracking traffic and reminding users of events. It serves as a camera, always on hand to capture moments. It serves as a GPS device, with apps like Waze guiding users through traffic.(CNBC Kif) It serves as a wallet, with "everything from vending machines to trains and taxis" (Apple Pay) accepting Apple Pay. It also serves as a literal remote control, changing channels when users misplace their TV remote controls. Bit by bit, iPhones, and smartphones in general, have become an irreplaceable part of our lives. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Social Connections</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the introduction of the iPhone, we have become more and more connected. For example, Facebook "reported having 1.23 billion [daily active users] on average for December 2016" (<a target="_blank" href="/USH_BreakingBarriers/Bibliography.html#muir">Muir</a>). More and more, since the introduction of the iPhone, social media use on smartphones has increased significantly. </p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Web Surfing</li>
</ol>
<p>Being able to surf the web with a browser like Safari allowed users to fully interact with websites. Because of the iPhone's ability to support browsers, phones were no longer limited to water-downed WAP-version websites or badly-rendered websites. The iPhone's capabilities allowed it to explore the web in its fullest form. This lead to increased web traffic from smartphones and increased the time the average person spent on the internet. </p>
