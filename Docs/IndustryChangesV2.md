# Industry Changes

In 1984, Apple introduced the Apple II, a revolutionary computer created by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. The computer shattered the barrier of technical complexity barricading the average person from using a computer by:

- implementing a graphical user interface

- implementing a keyboard

- pre-installing the computer with necessary programs

This computer does not come with pre-installed programs. | Shown above is the Apple II computer. It uses a graphical user interface (GUI) with a keyboard. It is sold with a basic operating system pre-installed.                            |

## Runs Out The Box

> "My Mac makes it so much easier for me to get the tools I need right when I need them and I always know they are going to work. With [other computers], I had to research software options, find one that I could download (or wait to get a disc in the mail) and then just hope it didn't crash my computer when I installed it.

Before the Apple II, there weren't many viable personal computers. The smaller cheaper computers were for hobbyists and came without programs pre-installed. Users had to manually code the programs or get copies from others. Again, this required a lot of computer related skills to achieve, supporting the barrier of complexity of computer complexity. Apple II changed this and led to a new industry standard. The Apple II computer came pre-assembled with an operating system (OS) and commands installed, which was a major step forward from the DIY computers of that day. This allowed the average person to also use the computer with less required knowledge beforehand.

## Standardization of the GUI

> Five years ago, technology hindered us, but with Apple, technology now lifts us."

Before Apple I and the Apple II, computers were very difficult to use. As stated in the previous page, using the computer required a large amount of effort and technical know-how. The Apple I and the Apple II was one of the first computers designed by default to use a video display for output and a keyboard for input. This allowed the input and output of text and other media, which made it significantly easier to use computers. This change negated the need for users to translate input and output to and from binary to represent their answers. Furthermore, thanks to the graphical interface, text could be outputted directly instead of needing to be translated from an ASCII number table. This shattered the barrier of complexity preventing personal use of computers by the general public. 

Eventually, because the GUI was more intuitive and efficient, it became an industry standard like it is today.
